# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of analysis
The purpose of the analysis in Deliverable 2 was to compare the differences (count and percentage) of positive (5-star) reviews between paid Vine reviews and unpaid non-Vine reviews to determine if there was any bias towards favourable reviews from paid Vine members within the lawn and garden Amazon Review dataset.

## Results
- There were 386 total Vine (paid) reviews and 48,717 total non-Vine (unpaid) review. The large majority of reviews in lawn and garden Amazon Review dataset were non-Vine reviews.
- There were 176 Vine reviews that were rated as 5-star and 24,026 non-Vine reviews that were rated as 5-star.
- 45.6% percent of total Vine reviews were rated as 5-star and 49.3% of total non-Vine reviews were rated as 5-star.

## Summary
- The results suggest a higher percentage of 5-star reviews (49.3%) within the unpaid non-Vine reviews comapared to the paid Vine reviews (45.6%). Based on these results, there is no indication of a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. If a positivity bias was present, there would likely be a significantly higher percentage of 5-star reviews within the paid Vine reviews compared to the unpaid non-Vine reviews. 
- Another analysis that could be completed to detemine positivity bias in the lawn and garden Amazon Review dataset would be to assess total vote counts between Vine vs. non-Vine reviews, to determine if Vine members were more included to vote more often on the products there were reviewing.
- As well, it would be interesting to note the 5-star rating percentage between reviewers that purchased the products vs. reviewers who did not purchase products. 
- Finally, it would be beneficial to use Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze the review bodies section of our dataset to determine if the content in the review bodies matched the 5-star positivity percentages in our analysis.
